# Java-Linked-List-Implementation
For this project, I used the IDE "IntelliJ" from Jetbrains. 
Acceptable input choices are integers from 1-7. 
Other integers terminate the program and non integers raise an error. 
As for the Product class Input, the first parameter only accepts an integer and the second and third only accept a string.
Linked List Node object takes AnyType extended to the Product class for data and a Node object for the next node.
